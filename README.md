# ðŸ’« LqGrAphi

GraphQL API library for Liquid Design ecosystem.

## Functions
- Auto types creation from PHP classes to TypeRegister (Storm entities)
- Autoload of Queries and Mutations
- Caching of schema
- Universal CRUD query, mutations and resolvers for generic generation and resolving
- Recursive data fetcher of Storm entities from database based on requested query (highly optimized - makes only one query per entity class - simulating dataloader)

## Recommendations

This package works great with extended packages with types for LQD packages:

## Getting started

### Installation

`composer require liquiddesign/lqgraphi`

### Configuration

```neon
extensions:
    typeRegister: LqGrAphi\LqGrAphiDI

typeRegister:
    resolversNamespace: EshopApi\Resolvers
    queryAndMutationsNamespace: EshopApi\Schema\Types
    types:
        output:
            customerGroup: EshopApi\Schema\Outputs\CustomerGroupOutput
            pricelist: EshopApi\Schema\Outputs\PricelistOutput
            address: EshopApi\Schema\Outputs\AddressOutput
            productGetProducts: EshopApi\Schema\Outputs\ProductGetProductsOutput
        crud:
            customer: [EshopApi\Schema\Outputs\CustomerOutput, EshopApi\Schema\Inputs\CustomerCreateInput, EshopApi\Schema\Inputs\CustomerUpdateInput]
            product: [EshopApi\Schema\Outputs\ProductOutput, EshopApi\Schema\Inputs\ProductCreateInput, EshopApi\Schema\Inputs\ProductUpdateInput]
```

### Entry point

In you entry point (probably `index.php`) you need to call handler. `GraphQLHandler::handle()` returns serializable array which you need to transform to JSON and send to output.

Example of `index.php`:

```php
$container = \EshopApi\Bootstrap::boot()->createContainer();

/** @var \LqGrAphi\GraphQLHandler $graphql */
$graphql = $container->getByType(\LqGrAphi\GraphQLHandler::class);
$request = $container->getByType(\Nette\Http\Request::class);
$response = $container->getByType(\Nette\Http\Response::class);

(new \Nette\Application\Responses\JsonResponse($graphql->handle()))->send($request, $response);
```

Full example of `index.php` can be found [here](https://github.com/liquiddesign/lqgraphi/tree/main/src/examples/index.php).

### Sandbox

Apollo Sandbox can be optionally included in entry point. HTML bundle is available in examples folder.

You have to add it to response in entry point.<br>
Example below only show sandbox when in debug mode. Advantage of using sandbox like in example is that you have full access to Tracy.

```php
if ($graphql->getDebugFlag() && $request->getMethod() === 'GET') {
	/** @var \Nette\Bridges\ApplicationLatte\LatteFactory $latteFactory */
	$latteFactory = $container->getByType(\Nette\Bridges\ApplicationLatte\LatteFactory::class);

	$compiledSandbox = $latteFactory->create()->renderToString(__DIR__ . '/apollo.sandbox.latte', ['baseUrl' => $request->getUrl()->getBaseUrl()]);

	(new \Nette\Application\Responses\TextResponse($compiledSandbox))->send($request, $response);

	die;
}
```

Full example of `index.php` and bundled html file of sandbox can be found [here](https://github.com/liquiddesign/lqgraphi/tree/main/src/examples).

### Queries and Mutations

Location of queries and mutations is set via config `queryAndMutationsNamespace`.
Query needs to extend `\LqGrAphi\Schema\BaseQuery` and mutation `\LqGrAphi\Schema\BaseMutation`.<br><br>
These types are automatically loaded only first time when schema is created and cached.
All other requests uses cached schema, due to that script don't need to create schema for every request and performance is not decreased.
This approach has some limitations: Queries and mutations are not registered in container so you cant use DI. All these classes will receive container as first argument.

### Types

Location of types is set via config `types`. You need to specify all used inputs and outputs here.

```neon
typeRegister:
    types:
        input:
            product: EshopApi\Schema\Inputs\ProductInput
        output:
            product: EshopApi\Schema\Outputs\ProductOutput
```

For more info visit documentation of [webonyx/graphql-php](https://webonyx.github.io/graphql-php/) library.

### Resolvers

Due to caching of whole schema creation, resolvers are isolated from schema and have to resolve request on their own.<br>
There is simple routing mechanism. GraphQL's queries and mutations names uses lower-camelCase.<br>
Name is parsed as first word in resolver class name and rest is function name.<br>
Example: `productGetMany` is parsed as `ProductResolver` and function `getMany`.

Signature of every resolver function must be:
```php
/**
 * @param array<mixed> $rootValue
 * @param array<mixed> $args
 * @param \LqGrAphi\GraphQLContext $context
 * @param \GraphQL\Type\Definition\ResolveInfo $resolveInfo
 * @return array<mixed>|null
 * @throws \LqGrAphi\Resolvers\Exceptions\BadRequestException
 * @throws \ReflectionException
 * @throws \StORM\Exception\GeneralException
 */
public function getMany(array $rootValue, array $args, GraphQLContext $context, ResolveInfo $resolveInfo): ?array
{
    ...
}
```

Recommended way of configuration

```neon
services:
	graphql_resolvers:
		in: %appDir%
		files: [Resolvers/*Resolver.php, Resolvers/*/*Resolver.php]
		implements:
		    - LqGrAphi\Resolvers\BaseResolver
```

### CRUD

You can write your types and queries by yourself, but most of the time you just want to take existing entity and make crud operations for it.

At that point comes `\LqGrAphi\Schema\CrudQuery` and `\LqGrAphi\Schema\CrudMutation`.

First, create query class

```php
class CustomerQuery extends CrudQuery
{
	public function getClass(): string
	{
		return Customer::class;
	}
}
```

then create output, create and update types with use of helpers:

```php
class CustomerOutput extends BaseOutput
{
	public function __construct(TypeRegister $typeRegister)
	{
		$config = [
			'fields' => $typeRegister->createOutputFieldsFromClass(Customer::class, exclude: ['account']),
		];

		parent::__construct($config);
	}
}
```

```php
class CustomerCreateInput extends BaseInput
{
	public function __construct(TypeRegister $typeRegister)
	{
		$config = [
			'fields' => $typeRegister->createInputFieldsFromClass(Customer::class, includeId: false, inputRelationFieldsEnum: InputRelationFieldsEnum::ONLY_ADD),

		];

		parent::__construct($config);
	}
}

```

```php
class CustomerUpdateInput extends BaseInput
{
	public function __construct(TypeRegister $typeRegister)
	{
		$config = [
			'fields' => $typeRegister->createInputFieldsFromClass(Customer::class, forceAllOptional: true),
		];

		parent::__construct($config);
	}
}
```

 register types in config
```neon
typeRegister:
    types:
        crud:
            customer: [EshopApi\Schema\Outputs\CustomerOutput, EshopApi\Schema\Inputs\CustomerCreateInput, EshopApi\Schema\Inputs\CustomerUpdateInput]
```

and lastly create resolver

```php
class CustomerResolver extends CrudResolver
{
	public function getClass(): string
	{
		return Customer::class;
	}
}
```
and that's all, you can query one, many or collection and mutate create, update and delete operations.

#### Helpers for CRUD

To help working with API there is some automatic improvements

- All array outputs are encapsulated in object with key *data* and *onPageCount*
- There is universal input objects for sorting, paging and filtering

#### Filtering

Filters are input fields of type JSON, which are parsed to repository *filter** functions.

#### Fetch result

There is universal fetch function. You just need to pass collection with ResolveInfo. It will take care of retrieving only data you asked in most efficient way.

### Language mutations
If you need to use different language mutation, you can use HTTP header "Accept-Language".
System will set detected language (if supported) as primary language for all SQL queries.
If no language in "Accept-Language" header is supported, then primary language from settings is used.

## Roadmap
- 
- Persisted queries with Redis/KeyDB
- Security - guards, login
- Automatic testing
- Query batching with dataloader
